# CCP istio-operator

Kubernetes operator to manage [istio service mesh](https://istio.io) in a k8s cluster.

This operator can be used to install, upgrade, repair, reconfigure and uninstall istio service mesh in a kubernetes cluster.

This repo was created using [kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder), an SDK framework for building Kubernetes APIs using [custom resource definitions (CRDs)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/extend-api-custom-resource-definitions).

[kubebuilder.md](https://wwwin-github.cisco.com/CPSG/ccp-istio-operator/blob/master/kubebuilder.md) has the steps that show how this repo was created using kubebuilder.
